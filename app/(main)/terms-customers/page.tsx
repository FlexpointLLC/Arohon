        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          The Services comprise mobile applications and related services (each, an &quot;Application&quot;), which enable users to arrange and schedule transportation services with third party providers of such services under agreement with the Company (&quot;Third Party Providers&quot;).

        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          The Company is a technology company that does not provide transportation services and the Company is not a transportation provider. It is up to the third-party transportation providers to offer transportation services to you and it is up to you to accept such transportation services. The service of the Company is to link you with such third-party transportation providers, but does not, and nor is it intended to, provide transportation services or any act that can be construed in any way as an act of a transportation provider.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          Accordingly, you unconditionally understand and acknowledge that your ability to obtain transportation services through the use of the services does not establish the Company as a provider of transportation services or as a transportation carrier and the Company is not, in any way whatsoever, responsible nor liable for the acts and/or omissions of any third party transportation provider and/or any transportation services provided to you.
